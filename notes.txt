TYPESCRIPT

LEC-1
-------
strongly typed - if it cannot be typecasted from big datatype to small datatype (small to big possible)

static typed - java, typescript -> error detected at compile time

loosely typed / weakly typed - if it can be typecasted from small to big nd vice versa

dynamic typed - python, javascript -> error detected at runtime(disadv)


download typescript - npm i -g typescript   [-g for global download]

1. initialize typescript : npx tsc --init   -> Create a new tsconfig.json  
2. .ts for file 
3. run -> to run code, runtime env needed. there is no runtime env for typescript.
            so first build ts code to js nd then node runs it.
            i) tsc -b   -> builds  (build everytime after any changes)
            ii) node js file (built)
        if there will be any error, it will show while running build command nd it will not allow u to build, 
        so never run ts code with node directly or it will ignore the ts nd run code normally as js code. 
        so no benefit of writing ts



tsconfig.json:
- "target": "esnext"
version of es(eg. es2016). write code in ts then specify here which version of es we want. it builds code in multiple versions

-    "rootDir": "./src", 
where written code of ts file

- "outDir": "./dist",
where to find js code of ts file

REACT
---------

To setup react project:
vite
1. npm create vite@latest
2. project-name -> select React -> JavaScript -> no -> yes

in app.jsx, delete all existing code, type rafce to create code template

to run, go in project folder, nd type "npm run dev" in terminal and open the page on port 5173

Features of React:
- react offers component based architecture
    Components are small resuable piece of code 

    + how to create a component?
      there are 2 types of components :
      1. functional components  -> to create it, use js functions which returns jsx code 
      2. class components  -> to create it, use

      every component should be used in App function otherwise it will not be seen on UI  -> <func_name></func_name>


    + why component should start with capital letter?
        so that component doesnot collide with html tags.
        otherwise, it will be traeted as html tag cz all html tags start from small letter so to differentiate capital letter


    + what is jsx?
        jsx -> JS XML
        jsx is a XML syntax which look like html and we can embed js expressions directly

        jsx vs html 
        1. in html, we use class attribute but in jsx className attribute 
        2. in jsx, every tag must have closing tag but in html there are tags like img,br,input which donot have closing tags
        3. in jsx, we can embed js expressions directly using {} but in html we have to use DOM manipulation


    + how many types of export do we have?
        2 types of export:
        1. default export  -> one file can have only 1 deafult export, to export others use named export
        2. named export  -> to export multiple things, use {} while import 


    + what are props?
        props are called properties and it is used to pass data from parent component to child component


- Virtual DOM(Document Object Model)
    2 DOMS exist - 
    - Real DOM -> DOM tree 
    - Virtual DOM -> lightweight copy of actual DOM
    in React, Virtual DOM exist -> it doesnot refresh the whole tree, instead just reload only what is changed
    Makes 2 virtual DOMS (prev and curr)

    DIFFING ALGORITHM 
    this algo finds the min no of changes to make in the current tree as compared to the prev state tree 
    thats why never change the prev state directly otherwise react will not be able to interpret what to change

    RECONCILIATION -> meaning?


settimeout() nad setinterval() return id -> we dont want to show show id on page so store in useref
useRef() return object with a single current property
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN USESTATE AND USEREF
                    USESTATE                                                                  USEREF 
change in state variable trigger re-rendering of component           change in useref variable doesnot trigger re-rendering of component
