HOISTING 
-----------
Hoisting is JavaScript’s default behavior in which all declarations move to the top during memory creation phase
eg. console.log(a+10)   -> NaN
    console.log(a)   -> undefined
    var a = 10
here, var a is declaration so it moves to the top but its initialization donot so it gives undefined nd nan 

JS runs the code twice line by line 
Global Execution Context -> 2 phases(memory creation, code execution)
memory creation                 code execution
var a = undefined               console.log(a+10) -> nan
                                console.log(a)  -> undefined 

Are let nd const variables hoisted?
- yes, let nd const variables are also hoisted but they are not initialized during memory creation phase. 
Its value is initialized during code execution phase.
eg.
clg(a);
let a = 10;
memory creation                 code execution
let a = _________               console.log(a) -> error: cannot access before initialization

let a;
log(a) -> it gives undefined cz if we dont initialize it, js assigns it as undefined 

let nd const dont get memory in memory creation phase bcz it gets special memory location in TDZ 
it comes out of TDZ when it is accessed during code execution
